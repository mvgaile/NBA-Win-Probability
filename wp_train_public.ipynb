    "# NBA Win Probability Model — Training Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the complete end-to-end pipeline used to build the NBA Win Probability Model, including data ingestion, data engineering, feature creation, model training, calibration, and evaluation. It produces the final neural-network model and calibration objects used in the real-time win probability generator.\n",

    "The first section of this notebook downloads all required play-by-play and game summary data from the NBA Stats API.

After approximately 600 requests, the NBA API typically stops responding or begins returning errors.\n",

    "- **cache** previously downloaded files to avoid repeated API calls.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🧹 Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "This section prepares the raw play-by-play and odds data so it can be reliably used for feature engineering and model training. The NBA Stats API often returns incomplete or irregular fields (such as missing scores, empty strings, inconsistent possession markers, or duplicated events), and the betting dataset includes occasional malformed or extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key cleaning steps include:\n",
    "- fixing missing or blank score fields using forward-fill logic,  \n",
    "- correcting inconsistent possession or event markers,  \n",
    "- reconciling regulation and overtime time formats,  \n",
    "- removing or capping extreme sportsbook outliers, and  \n",
    "- ensuring all numeric fields are properly typed and aligned.\n",

    "\n",
    "Raw play-by-play data from the NBA Stats API arrives as a long list of individual events—shots, turnovers, rebounds, fouls, substitutions, etc. While this format is useful for descriptive analysis, it is **not directly usable** for win probability modeling. The model requires a unified representation of the game at each moment in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, the event-level PBP data is transformed into a sequence of **game states**, where each state represents a snapshot of the game after every meaningful update (score change, possession change, or time change). This process involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- extracting scores, possession, period, and clock at each event,  \n",
    "- computing `seconds_remaining_game` across regulation and overtime,  \n",
    "- carrying forward score and possession information between events,  \n",
    "- identifying meaningful transitions (e.g., new possession, score update), and  \n",
    "- constructing one clean row per game state with synchronized fields.\n",
